# Welcome To Joseph Shinaberry's ePortfolio
## Mission Statement 
Creating something that was not there before, from the spark of imagination -- generated into reality. With each character entered, and with each line saved -- closing in on the ultimate goal to create a solution to make someoneâ€™s life easier, more productive, and finally using technology to its fullest potential. My name is Joseph Shinaberry and I am a Software Developer.

# Artifact 1: Software Engineering / Design
The first artifact is a program known as the Stock Tracker program that was built for CS-340 Advanced Programming Concepts and is a combination of logic, user interface, and NoSQL database structuring. I altered the architecture to all the code to become more modular, the previous architecture of the application contained redundant code that connected to the database from all files. This was a security risk and had to be mitigated by creating a single file that handles database requests. 


# Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
The second artifact also uses the Stock Tracker program as a starting point. The enhancements to this application include a data structure that holds JSON data from an external API kindly provided by Alpha Vantage. The live data is then compared to the stored data in the NoSQL database and compares the values with a custom algorithm.
