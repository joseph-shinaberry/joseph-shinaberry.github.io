# Welcome To Joseph Shinaberry's ePortfolio
## Mission Statement 
Creating something that was not there before, from the spark of imagination -- generated into reality. With each character entered, and with each line saved -- closing in on the ultimate goal to create a solution to make someone’s life easier, more productive, and finally using technology to its fullest potential. My name is Joseph Shinaberry and I am a Software Developer. 

## Self Assesment
>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and starting on the first one.” - Mark Twain

Breaking down complex problems into modular and manageable blocks is what an experienced Software Developer such as myself, does on a daily basis. Throughout my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I found that defining a solution for a complex problem was easily managed by breaking down the problem. For Example, a complex mathematical equation may not be solved by starting from left to right but by viewing the entire equation and following the proper order of operations. This is what one must do when creating a software solution, a typical novelist top-down approach is not applicable, and should be substituted for an agile and modular approach. 

The values that I bring to the table are two-fold the first being highly motivated in my field of technology, and the undeterred drive to grow with knowledge in the industry. With the tech industry moving into the future with ever nanosecond staying current on technology is a requirement for any experienced Software Developer.

# Artifact 1: Software Engineering / Design
The first artifact is a program known as the Stock Tracker program that was built for CS-340 Advanced Programming Concepts and is a combination of logic, user interface, and NoSQL database structuring. I altered the architecture to all the code to become more modular, the previous architecture of the application contained redundant code that connected to the database from all files. This was a security risk and had to be mitigated by creating a single file that handles database requests. 


# Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
The second artifact also uses the Stock Tracker program as a starting point. The enhancements to this application include a data structure that holds JSON data from an external API kindly provided by Alpha Vantage. The live data is then compared to the stored data in the NoSQL database and compares the values with a custom algorithm.

# Artifact 3: Databases
The third artifact is an example of the Stock Tracker program completely re-written into a LAMP stack. While the aforementioned artifacts are written in Python & JavaScript with MongoDB as the database. However, the new version is solely written in PHP language and uses MySQL as the database. I will compare the different languages involving database interaction as an example of different database interactions.
