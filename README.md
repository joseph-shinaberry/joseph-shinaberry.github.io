# Artifact 1: Software Engineering / Design
The first artifact is a program known as the Stock Tracker program that was built for CS-340 Advanced Programming Concepts and is a combination of logic, user interface, and NoSQL database structuring. I altered the architecture to all the code to become more modular, the previous architecture of the application contained redundant code that connected to the database from all files. This was a security risk and had to be mitigated by creating a single file that handled database requests.
